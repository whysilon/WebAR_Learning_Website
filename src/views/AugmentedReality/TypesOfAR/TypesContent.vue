      There are many different ways to visualise AR. In the previous section, we have seen many
      different types of AR representations. In this section, we will be discussing the many
      different types of AR and how they all still embody the concept of AR.

      Perhaps the simplest way to describe a Head-Worn Display (HWD) is through wearing sunglasses
      except the shaded lens are see-through and additional virtual elements are displayed on the
      lenses. This allow the user to see the physical world along with any virtual enhancements such
      as information of the current situation or directions to a location.

    <p>
      An example of a "see-through" display would be your phone or tablet. The cameras on your phone
      or tablet will act as the "sensors" to capture the physical environment and the screen would
      display the physical envrionment with the virtual elements embedded into the environment

    <h1 id="Projection-Display">Projection Display</h1>
    <p>
      A projection-based display involves layering virtual elements on top of the actual physical
      environment with the use of projectors and sensors to detect any interaction from the user.
