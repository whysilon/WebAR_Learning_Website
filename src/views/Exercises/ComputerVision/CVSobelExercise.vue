  <h1>Sobel Filter</h1>
  <p>
    As discussed in <a href="/docs/CV/object-tracking"> Object Tracking</a>, Sobel filter is a very
    powerful tool to detect and extract edges in an image. This allows many algorithms to track
    objects based on the interesting parts of the image as it is akin to humans recognising objects
    based on their shape.
