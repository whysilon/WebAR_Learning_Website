    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> Have you ever wondered how our eyes perceive the text you are currently reading? How are we
        able to "see" what we are seeing? And the last question is, how do cameras or computers even
        take pictures or videos and convert them into somethign that they can understand?

        In this module, we will be introducing the ideas of computer vision and how AR uses it to 
        create the magic that we see in our phones and other devices. We will be discussing the different
        methods which computers use to perceive and distinguish the objects and environment around them.
