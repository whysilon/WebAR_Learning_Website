    Have you ever wondered how our eyes perceive the text you are currently reading? How are we able
    to "see" what we are seeing? And the last question is, how do cameras or computers even take
    pictures or videos and convert them into somethign that they can understand?
  </p>
  <p>
    In this module, we will be introducing the ideas of computer vision and how AR uses it to create
    the magic that we see in our phones and other devices. We will be discussing the different
    methods which computers use to perceive and distinguish the objects and environment around them.

  <p>
    For humans, we perceive the environment by using our eyes. This works through the process of
    light hitting surfaces and reflecting the light into our eyes. Our eyes then turn this light
    into electrical signals which will turn the signals into images in our brain. For computers,
    they do not have our eyes nor our processing system, but it works in a similar way. To
    substitute the eyes, computers use cameras to capture the light to turn it to electrical
    signals. The computer then processes the signals to create a format in which it can understand
    and interpret the environment around them. To understand it better, let us assume that we have
    this 4 by 4 grid below:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <Image src="/src/assets/picture.png" alt="4x4 Grid" />
    <p>4 by 4 grid</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Our eyes see this very simply, just a grid of black and white rectangles. However, for a
    computer, it sees this as a 4 by 4 matrix of numbers. Black is represented by 0 and white is
    represented by 1. As computers can only understand 1s and 0s, this format helps to convert the
    image into something that the computer can understand. So in this case, the computer sees the
    image as: (1, 0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1).
